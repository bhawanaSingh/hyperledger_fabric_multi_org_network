## Multi_Org Config

Note that this multi_org configuration uses pre-generated certificates and key material, and also has predefined transactions to initialize a channel named "mychannel".

To regenerate this material, simply run ./byfn.sh - generate.

To start the network, run ./byfn.sh up. To stop it, run ./byfn.sh down To completely remove all incriminating evidence of the network on your system, run .byfn.sh teardown.
